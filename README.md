# SpectroBird-Birdcall-Recognition-System
Implemented a YAMNet model for transfer learning instead of traditional Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model
thereby increasing accuracy by 15%. Improved the model by including random forest recordings in the dataset, which effectively mitigated noise, produced
an outstanding 96% accuracy rate for the precise detection and enumeration of bird vocalizations.
